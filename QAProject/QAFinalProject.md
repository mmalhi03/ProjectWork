This was the final project for the QA Data Engineering Bootcamp. The tasks of the project were as follows: 
Import a dataset
Clean the data/fill in missing values
Complete some analysis on the data
Train and test using various machine learning models
Export the model and deploy using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio

We got the option of which dataset we wanted to work with. I chose a dataset on loan applications with their status’. The aim of this dataset was to get the model predicting the loan status whilst feeding the variables of the applications. 

I have made comments throughout the notebook explaining either plots or explaining how I’ve come to a decision.

I have also included the data that I have used in this folder.
